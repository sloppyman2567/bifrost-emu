# Android native runtime bootstrap

Checkpoint: October 5, 2026. Bifrost can enter a real guest ARM64 Android
linker and execute Bionic-linked programs. Signed APK installation and native-only
NativeActivity launch now work through this runtime; see [ANDROID_APK.md](ANDROID_APK.md).
ART VM creation and SpongeBob's managed Activity remain unsupported. A separate
same-image ART/libcore provisioner and experimental DEX/JNI bootstrap now exist;
see the bounded checkpoint below.
The APK native-load diagnostic now checks real packaged dependencies separately:
19/21 SpongeBob libraries complete loading/cleanup in all three execution modes.
Firebase Messaging's direct probe loads successfully, then double-destroys a
shared mutex on exit. Explicitly preloading Firebase App fixes that probe's
cleanup in all three modes and QEMU. See [the APK checkpoint](ANDROID_APK.md)
for the load-order evidence and official-header/zlib build.
An optional checksum-pinned real Media NDK bundle now supplies the genuine
library and its isolated native dependencies. Real metadata operations pass
the signed APK gate in all modes. With this bundle Unity progresses to a
missing `eglSurfaceAttrib` export; media services/decoding and ART are still
unimplemented. See the APK guide for provisioning and namespace boundaries.

## Reproduce

The fixture needs Python 3, `debugfs` from e2fsprogs, Clang and LLD. It does
not require an Android SDK or download a complete system image.

```bash
make -j6
python3 tools/fetch-android-runtime.py
bash scripts/test_android_bionic.sh
```

The fetcher pins the official AOSP `prebuilts/runtime` APEX at revision
`8aeb37cca394ce39c1311744c60960cbd466aa77` (the `android-15.0.0_r1` repository
revision), checks archive and extracted-file SHA-256 hashes, retains its
license notices, and installs only linker64, libc, libdl, libdl_android and
libm under `tools/android-runtime/rootfs`. A repository tag is provenance;
these reused prebuilts alone do not establish an API 35 platform build.
The directory is ignored by Git. An existing verified installation is reused;
modified runtime files are rejected rather than overwritten.

The test compiles a 16 KiB-aligned ARM64 fixture against these actual libraries,
then exercises fixed/random ASLR with interpreter, default JIT and opt-in Tier 2.
It checks constructors, initial auxv, Bionic page size, pthread creation/join,
independent ELF TLS and errno, runtime dlopen/dlsym/dlclose, a libm result,
Binder device opening/mapping and no-new-privileges through Bionic wrappers.
It requires a success marker and rejects fatal-signal/crash output, since a
guest fatal handler can otherwise exit with code zero.

Manual invocation after building the fixture:

```bash
./bifrost-emu --android-runtime --rootfs tools/android-runtime/rootfs \
    /data/local/tmp/bootstrap
```

This bootstrap command requires an absolute guest executable path and a
rootfs containing `/system/bin/linker64` (or its runtime-APEX equivalent).
The guest linker owns relocation, library resolution and TLS. Bifrost does
not create its Linux custom DynamicLinker or synthetic TLS block for this
profile. ELF load bias respects PT_LOAD alignment; interpreter reservation
protects holes and prevents later mmap allocations overlapping the image.

## Experimental same-image ART bootstrap

The managed-runtime experiment uses a separate root from the small Bionic
bootstrap and the Media NDK namespace. It extracts ARM64 ART, Bionic, libcore,
ICU, Conscrypt, timezone data and native dependencies from the official
[API-35 ARM64 SDK image, revision 2](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sys-img/android/arm64-v8a-35_r02.zip).
Its build identity is `AE3A.240806.019/12368160`, with image SHA-256
`1e6ae4fca6449c07278a333311f0ef29c5101d1e3e18ba48fbe9bd2dc5006926`.
The provisioner verifies the archive and all 309 extracted file hashes,
symlink targets and executable flags. It keeps the upstream notices and
records the native dependency graph in `bifrost-art.json`. This is a bootstrap
artifact set, without a framework installation or boot image.

```bash
python3 tools/android_art.py
python3 tools/build-android-jni.py --javac /path/to/javac
BIFROST_NO_ASLR=1 python3 scripts/test_android_jni.py --timeout 60
```

Requirements: Python 3.11+, `debugfs`, `lpunpack`, `readelf`, Clang/LLD and a
JDK 17+. The image download is approximately 734 MiB; extraction needs several GiB
of scratch disk space. An existing verified Media NDK source archive is reused.
The DEX compiler is checksum-pinned D8 from AOSP `android-15.0.0_r1`.
Generated runtime files and fixtures stay under ignored `build/` directories.

The runner copies the verified runtime into a temporary root, adds writable
data and fixtures, enforces a timeout, and saves logs plus JSON results in
`build/android-jni-results/`. The launcher calls the real `JNI_CreateJavaVM`
with ART JIT disabled, CheckJNI enabled and a small 16/64 MiB heap. The fixture
is intended to load an ARM64 JNI library, register a native method, access an
array/string, call back into Java and shut down cleanly. Success requires its
marker and a zero exit; `ART_LOAD_OK` alone does not pass the gate.

October 5 checkpoint: real ART loads. The fixed-address JIT probe now reaches
unsupported `UADALP` (`0x6e206b17`, `uadalp v23.8h, v24.16b`) during VM creation,
after about 11 seconds. VM creation and the DEX/JNI marker do not pass.
The interpreter probe also loads ART and terminates with guest SIGILL.
GC, thread attachment, exceptions and managed Activity startup remain unverified.
This experiment neither registers a fake JavaVM nor changes the existing
native-only APK launch contract. JNI objects and calls remain guest-owned,
consistent with [Android's JNI guidance](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/jni-tips).

The experiment exposed and repaired ordinary mmap hint handling, ARM64 open
flag translation, executable procfs opens and main-stack metadata. Low hints
try a free range at or above the requested address inside the direct window,
then use the ordinary allocator when none fits. They never replace occupied
mappings; fixed mapping behavior remains separate. Virtual hinted reservations
discard old contents lazily. `/proc/self/stat` reports the actual initial guest
SP, needed by [Bionic's main-stack lookup](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/refs/tags/android-15.0.0_r1/libc/bionic/pthread_internal.cpp).
Other stat accounting fields remain approximate or zero, and maps permissions
remain the existing coarse view. `/proc/self/exe` follows the selected executable
file; `O_PATH|O_NOFOLLOW` symlink descriptors are explicitly unsupported, and
reopening an executable after it is deleted/replaced is not modeled.

## Pointer tags and page sizes

Bionic's Scudo allocator uses top-byte tags internally even without MTE.
The Android profile ignores the top byte on data accesses, preserves the
pointer's register value, and keeps mapping/protection checks on the resolved
address. It covers direct/sparse memory, atomics, thunk pointer translation and
forked memory state. Instruction addresses are not untagged. This is data TBI,
not MTE support or permission to claim memory-tag checking works.

Runtime pages remain 4096 bytes. The fixture uses 16384-byte ELF alignment;
the real Android linker, pthreads and dlopen work with this combination in
Bifrost and QEMU. This agrees with [AOSP's documented support for 16 KiB
alignment on 4 KiB and 16 KiB kernels](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/16kb-page-size/16kb).
A 16 KiB runtime requires coherent syscall, allocator and protection semantics,
not an auxv-only change.

The Binder transport and syscall-option checkpoint is documented in
[ANDROID_BINDER.md](ANDROID_BINDER.md), including its unsupported operations.

## APK inspection

```bash
python3 tools/fetch-aapt2.py
python3 scripts/android_preflight.py /path/to/package.apkm --output report.json
python3 scripts/test_android_preflight.py
```

The preflight tool reads manifests/splits, DEX inventory, ARM64 native imports,
entry points and PT_LOAD alignment. It never runs the package. An alignment
report is not a compatibility verdict or signature verification.

SpongeBob 5.11.5 requires a managed `CleverTapOverrideActivity` launcher and
Android framework services despite using IL2CPP for its engine. All 21 packaged
ARM64 libraries have 16 KiB alignment. The next major gate is guest ART/libcore
with DEX-to-JNI calls, callbacks, reference lifetimes, GC and thread suspension;
the native checkpoint does not establish those capabilities.

## Additional verification

```bash
bash scripts/test_android_loader.sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh --filter 'simd_addlv|crc32_instructions'
./scripts/run_tests.sh --no-jit --filter 'simd_addlv|crc32_instructions'
```

`android_loader_host` checks aligned image reservation, malformed ELF rejection,
tagged data access/protection behavior and exact CRC opcode validity.
`jit_simd_addlv` covers 2,624 signed/unsigned widening reductions and pairwise
adds, including operand aliases and all valid widths. `jit_crc32` covers
2,048 IEEE/Castagnoli cases with an independent bitwise oracle. Both instruction
fixtures also pass QEMU and Tier-1 differential verification.

After audio fix `9403911`, the strict ART-foundation Linux suite passes 275/275
in default JIT mode and 268/268 in interpreter mode, with seven expected
JIT-only skips. AAudio passes in both full runs. The earlier native
checkpoint passed 273/273 and 266/266 respectively. All six Bionic bootstrap
variants pass after the mmap/procfs changes; see [test evidence](TESTS.md).
The subsequent AAudio wake-up fix passes 20 callback stress runs, including
injected delayed waits in both engines, and four neighboring audio/thread tests
per engine. This resolves a reproducible lost-notification race without raising
the guest fixture's callback deadline. The older interpreter checkpoint's
267/268 result remains recorded in [test evidence](TESTS.md).
